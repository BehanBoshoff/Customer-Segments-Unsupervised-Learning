# Customer-Segments-Unsupervised-Learning
In this project, I have worked with real-life data provided to me by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution.
The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. 
Their main question of interest was to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 
My job as a data scientist was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, 
then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. 
Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I have also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
Clusters were generated using the KMeans clustering algorithm.
